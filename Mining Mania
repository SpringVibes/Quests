Mining Mania

[1/7] Miner Affron: Hey… You
[2/7] Miner Affron: Agh… Don’t mind me leg, it’ll be alright…
[3/7] Miner Affron: What happened you’re askin’? 
[4/7] Miner Affron: The cave just suddenly collapsed! That’s what ‘appened!
[5/7] Miner Affron: We have no idea how it even happened! We had all the safety precautions!
[6/7] Miner Affron: …I’ll tell ya what mate, if you investigate the cave, I’ll pay you with a little bit of the one-two, y’know?
[7/7] Miner Affron: Yeah, you go in there, find how it happened, return to me and I’ll give you a lil bit of the cash.
<You enter the cave, there’s one {Ragged Cloth} in there. Return to Miner Affron with it>

[1/7] Miner Affron: A ragged cloth, eh?
[2/7] Miner Affron: What could this have come from? Our miners wear black, not brown!
[3/7] Miner Affron: You should check in with Sheriff—What’s his face?
[4/7] Miner Affron: Yeah, check in with that bloke. He’ll be able to recognise it.
[5/7] Miner Affron: He’s got some pretty good stuff going for him. He might—MIGHT help you.
[6/7] Miner Affron: If you give him some gold, he’ll probably give you the answers you’re looking for. He’s a pretty corrupt cop.
[7/7] Miner Affron: Here’s the gold, [32 Gold] Should do.
<You speak to the Sheriff>

[1/8] Sheriff Mattock: Ah… yes… That’s… Oh yes!
[2/8] Sheriff Mattock: Who the- Who’re you?
[3/8] Sherriff Mattock: You want me to inspect this cloth? Hah! Fat chance.
[4/8] Sheriff Mattock: Well… Maybe some gold is to change my mind.
<You give him the 32 gold>
[5/8] Sheriff Mattock: Yes… My lovelies… 
[6/8] Sheriff Mattock: Oh- Right. Your cloth, lemme get that sorted, son.
[7/8] Sheriff Mattock: What is it? That’s a bandit cloth, son.
[8/8] Sheriff Mattock: Looks like it’s got a name tag in as well, might wanna check it out.
[9/11] Sheriff Mattock: What will I do?! Nothing, mate. Unless you wanna hand over another… let’s say… [500000000 Gold]? Hah. 
[10/11] Sheriff Mattock: Anyway, have fun with that bandit camp mate. They’ll probably kill you if ya try to get in, savages, they are.
[11/11] Sherrif Mattock: Now, let me get back to my business…

<You have to infiltrate the camp in 1.5 minutes, there is parkour leading to the main tent>
<If you fail, you’ll be teleported to the start & the timer will be reset>

[1/2] Bandit Boss Barden: I sense an intruder! Show yourself!
[2/2] Bandit Boss Barden: Intruder! Show your face in battle!

<You fight the boss, he drops a [Bandit Camp Note]>

Bandit Camp note
1.	Blow up the mine
2.	Frame that pest Mattock
3.	Get Sandy to get the beef ready.

[1/4] Miner Affron: Oh… you’re back! What’s this?
[2/4] Miner Affron: Bandits, eh? Huh, I’ll get them back! I swear I’ll kill them!!
[3/4] Miner Affron: Wait… you did that too? Great work, I must admit.
[4/4] Miner Affron: As promised, here’s your reward.
